- [Create a Blog](#blog)

## Blog

Since "GitHub pages is deeply integrated with [Jekyll][Jekyll]" I'll be taking advantage of that to create a Markdown driven blog.

This blog will serve as a place to posts articles about certain projects of mine and random stuff that's on my mind. Mainly about programming and code development.

## Portfolio

I want a place to contemplate all my big/small achievements. My own virtual trophy room! Here I'll reference project repositories, live demos and other related websites hopefully with cool images or animations.

## Resume

We all know and respect the standard "Curriculum Vitae", plain, simple and boring. But we also know that web developers can (and should) be more creative. So I'll take it upon myself to create a more interesting CV. If done correctly the CV will speak for it self.

## Biography

Get to know me and my unstable puns.
